# atlas-upscaler
upscale atlas files


used to upscale any atlas file. hopefully.   

you need to manually put the file path ( drop the file in ./files ), put the current size and the expected, should only work for upscaling not downscaling.  

upscaled file will be in ./output  

should work with any node version that handles the fs module  

node index.js once everything is set up
